# Personal Website

I just put random shit on here, dont mind me please. This is based of my sites.google.com/view/gaphoto website since i want to learn more HTML and CSS.
I'm gonna learn in the future to make a bar at the top of the screen like my google sites website, mostly for navagation purposes.

Made this with Visual Studio Code and the Live Preview extension, most of the programming done on a Linux, Windows and MacBook Pro

I used a lot of CSS Cheat Sheets and button references to create the custom CSS you see on this website.

# Plans

I want to create some more pages of just photos, mainly just for showing off some old photos i have and also having a place to share them.
Create hover over button sounds and clicked sounds, released sounds and deny sounds.
Clean the website up a little bit, mainly the look and feel of it.
