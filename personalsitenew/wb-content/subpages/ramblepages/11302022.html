<p>I am pretty excited for the new Sons of The Forest game coming out next year. I've seen the trailers and everything for it an it looks like a much, much better game than the last one. The new graphics and new look of it gives me a Canadian Country feel since I've lived and stayed out in Canadas Country.</p>
<p>The weapons showcased in the trailer is a nice touch, something better then the Flintlock Pistol in the original game. The crafting and everything looks more realistic but i can see it getting in the way for say, you want to build a base with spiked walls and you have to break one log at a time. That would get very annoying very fast, they might have a system where you can just build it with the logs already with spikes? I don't know, the game hasn't had any gameplay videos yet from Endnight so, honestly who knows.</p>
<p>That woman in the trailer, I hope she's not like a character you have to interact with because that would be annoying in a game like The Forest. I've heard in a Q&A with Endnight from Farkets YouTube Channel that you can scare her away or not do anything with her? Just gonna do that, I don't like looking after NPCs in video games since they are just programmed AI.</p>
<p>I'm honestly surprised that Sons of The Forest is even Unity game, since it looks like a proprietary or Unreal Engine 5 Game. They've done a damn good job and they deserve all the credit they can get for the amazing game that is The Forest and Sons of The Forest,  it sucks that it had to be delayed, but I get game development is not an easy process, since I do it myself and, yeah no it's not easy AT ALL, lol.</p>
