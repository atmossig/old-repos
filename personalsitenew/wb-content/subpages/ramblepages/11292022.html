<p>Ever since a friend gifted me The Forest on steam, I've gotta say, holy shit its the best survival game I've ever played. The gameplay is really good, story, graphics and everything else about it is really good. I've already spent the healthy amount of 150+ hours on the game since I got it. </p>

<p>I've seen the teasers and trailers for the next game "Sons of The Forest" and I honestly cant wait any longer. The next game looks amazing than the last and the gameplay seems a lot better. They're adding actual firearms instead of some old ass pistol lol. Nothing was wrong with the flint-lock pistol but it's very slow but does good damage. The building in the next game looks a lot better then what we got in The Forest, blueprints are straight-up cursed half the damn time in The Forest lmfao.</p>
