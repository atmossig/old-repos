<p>I've learned a lot over the past week about how Github Pages works, the button links the most and css. This is has been good so far except a few roadblocks but i'll figure them out eventually, like i did with the link problem to other html pages, which was so easy (im stupid) you have to add /reponame/index.html or page.html not /page.html or something stupid.</p>
