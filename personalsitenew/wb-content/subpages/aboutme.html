<title>About Me</title>
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This page does not go indepth about much of my personal life, i keep that private. This page is mostly facts about me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi, I do programming and level design in Source Engine, I work on Deathmatch Classic Refragged (DMCR), I am a playtester for Lambda Fortress as well and I also program my own stuff.</p>
<p>I was born in Canada and lived there most my life until last year, I moved to Washington. I've been wanting to work at Valve Software for quite sometime but I want to finish one of my more important projects before I try to get a job there. It sucks that i don't see my family much anymore, since i'm so far away now but I brought my girlfriend and my dog along the ride. I meet up with my parents on holidays mostly.</p>
<p>I plan that when I'm in my 30s or 40s I'll probably go around the whole world since I haven't been much out of Canada and United States.</p>
<p>I still do some source engine level design and programming, but I got very burnt out, i'm crawling back to it now but yeah.</p>
