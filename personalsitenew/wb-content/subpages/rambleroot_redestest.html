        <p>I just ramble about random stuff here, i made this redesign since seprate pages were kind of getting annoying to make. This new window design fits what my website is going for, i was inspired off of someone else doing it and i decided to do it as well. I hope this fits, and i tried my best to make it look good.</p>

        <p>Happy Holidays!</p>

        <h1>Modern Warfare II</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I found out rumors about a map editor gonna be in Modern Warfare II and I think that's a good idea, if it's true. There hasn't been a map editor since BO3 (2015) so it would be really cool to see the new Radiant they use for newer titles. Question, if they release a map editor, would it use Steam Workshop or their own system.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I thought of this when I saw the rumors and I feel like a Steam Workshop integration like Black Ops III would be nice since Steam did all the hard work for setting up the Workshop, now they just got to set up directory's or something (I don't know how its like coding workshop support) Alternatively, they could release mod tools to make custom campaigns with custom weapons and shit like that, just like COD4 or WaW.</p>

            <h1>The Forest</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Ever since a friend gifted me The Forest on steam, I've gotta say, holy shit its the best survival game I've ever played. The gameplay is really good, story, graphics and everything else about it is really good. I've already spent the healthy amount of 150+ hours on the game since I got it. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I've seen the teasers and trailers for the next game "Sons of The Forest" and I honestly cant wait any longer. The next game looks amazing than the last and the gameplay seems a lot better. They're adding actual firearms instead of some old ass pistol lol. Nothing was wrong with the flint-lock pistol but it's very slow but does good damage. The building in the next game looks a lot better then what we got in The Forest, blueprints are straight-up cursed half the damn time in The Forest lmfao.</p>

        <h1>Sons of The Forest</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I am pretty excited for the new Sons of The Forest game coming out next year. I've seen the trailers and everything for it an it looks like a much, much better game than the last one. The new graphics and new look of it gives me a Canadian Country feel since I've lived and stayed out in Canadas Country.</p>
        <p>The weapons showcased in the trailer is a nice touch, something better then the Flintlock Pistol in the original game. The crafting and everything looks more realistic but i can see it getting in the way for say, you want to build a base with spiked walls and you have to break one log at a time. That would get very annoying very fast, they might have a system where you can just build it with the logs already with spikes? I don't know, the game hasn't had any gameplay videos yet from Endnight so, honestly who knows.</p>
        <p>That woman in the trailer, I hope she's not like a character you have to interact with because that would be annoying in a game like The Forest. I've heard in a Q&A with Endnight from Farkets YouTube Channel that you can scare her away or not do anything with her? Just gonna do that, I don't like looking after NPCs in video games since they are just programmed AI.</p>
        <p>I'm honestly surprised that Sons of The Forest is even Unity game, since it looks like a proprietary or Unreal Engine 5 Game. They've done a damn good job and they deserve all the credit they can get for the amazing game that is The Forest and Sons of The Forest,  it sucks that it had to be delayed, but I get game development is not an easy process, since I do it myself and, yeah no it's not easy AT ALL, lol.</p>

        <h1>Forza Horizon</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I forgot how good the Forza Games were, I just recently re-installed Forza Horizon 4 and have been playing for hours straight. When I move my computer downstairs on the big screen it just looks fantastic, the game looks photo-real, I've heard Horizon 5 uses photogrammetry for props and detail and thats awesome. Photogrammetry can really create stunning scenes, most notably in Unreal Engine 5</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It would be cool to have Modding Tools for the Horizon games in the Forza game series, people could create custom maps, custom cars, create new gamemodes, etc. People could create new big open worlds for players to explore and drive around, but, they dont offer modding tools. The closest we've got to "under the hood" of Forza Tech is a debug menu that leaked with a OpusDev build (i think) and it was for Forza 3. Now thinking about it, i might buy Forza 3 on PC and use the debug menu, it looks really cool to fuck with :)</p>

        <h1>GitHub Pages</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I've learned a lot over the past week about how Github Pages works, the button links the most and css. This is has been good so far except a few roadblocks but i'll figure them out eventually, like i did with the link problem to other html pages, which was so easy (im stupid) you have to add /reponame/index.html or page.html not /page.html or something stupid.</p>

        <h1>Sons of The Forest (again)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>A new preview for Sons of The Forest came out and the game looks so good, like i've said already a million times. That ai companion looks neat and all, don't think ill use him a lot or any companions on another playthrough since i want to see what its like without companions on a second playthrough. Still the game looks really good.</p>
