# GMOD-CssLuaWeapons
This is my source code for the Counter-Strike Source Weapons, do not steal this code, if found than i will take it down. You can edit it to your free will but do not re-post this
same version, i like when people actually edit code and not just reupload it and says its theirs. You can download it for server content on.

To Install this drag it into your addons folder in garrysmod/addons
But, make a folder under lua called weapons and than put the weapon
in that to show up.
